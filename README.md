YALNIZ API - Veterinary Practice Management API
===============================================

YalnÄ±z Api is a RESTful API in monolithic architecture written in Java and Spring Boot.
Production database is PostgreSQL. For testing purposes, though, you may use H2 Embedded database as it is currently
configured.

This project was originally developed as the capstone project of Java Spring Boot module
of Patika+ Java/React FullStack Web Development bootcamp organized by [Patika](https://patika.dev).

For the mentioned bootcamp's final capstone project (which can be found [here](https://github.com/gokdenizozkan/yalniz-app)), it was revised and extended to include more features.
This repository, with version 2.0.0 and above, is the updated version of the project, and will only include backend
codes.
To see the old version, please switch back to v1.0.0.

The final capstone project also requires a frontend part, which is a React application. However, this is out of topic
for this repository.

## What's in the name?

YALNIZ was the name I gave to a cat. She was a little one,
wandering **ALONE** in the forest where she saw me and ran in the hope of finding a new home.
She was a very cute and lovely cat. Could not bring her with me when I got back to the city.

One day, when I came back to the village, she was gone. Nowhere to be found.
Then I heard from the folks around. They told me that she was a strong one.
That she would bully the other cats in the village. That she was a fighter. That she was a survivor.
Yet she was found dead by the road, lived **YALNIZ** and died **ALONE**.

In the memory of YALNIZ, I named this project after her.

## How to test the project

To run the project,

- install Java 21.
- clone the repository.
- open your favorite IDE and import the project as a Maven project.

After starting the application, you can test the by sending requests to the API.
This document will be updated to add an http file to populate the database with mock data.
